Members of the Victoria Barracks Cooperative and active neighbors from the Helenen neighborhood have formed the "Fuxonauts," a group that implements urban climate action and creates places to preserve biodiversity.

Funded by the Hamburg Climate Fund and the Hamburg Climate Protection Foundation, they have built a nesting wall and planted perennials for wild bees.

Why is this so important?â€¨\
Plants need to be pollinated by insects to bear fruit and seeds. Plants promote the necessary cooling microclimate in a heating city. 

Wild bees need nesting opportunities to reproduce and to permanently colonize an area.\
\
To this end, the wild bee nesting wall now being constructed at Victoria Barracks provided wooden nesting opportunities and reed stalks with different hole sizes for species nesting in cavities. A loess wall serves for the wild bees nesting in steep walls, and rotten wood is available for the wood dwellers.
\
The concept envisages that this biotope will lead to a sustainable strengthening of the bee population. The project is flanked by education of the neighborhood. For example, it will be communicated that flower species such as horned clover or sage planted on balconies are very beneficial for the preservation of the bee population in the neighborhood and at the same time allow the observation of bees and bumblebees at close range.\
\
The Fuxonauts are looking for more dedicated comrades-in-arms to assist with upcoming projects to help reintroduce important insects to neighborhoods and create ecological microreserves.
\
A task for the future that fascinates children and young people in particular and makes them mindful.
